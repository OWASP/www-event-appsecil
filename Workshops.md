## Workshops Day

These workshops is **NOT** for security experts with many years of experience, but for the rest of us:   

The aim is to provide a hands-on, crash course in key application security topics for developers, QA engineers, and anyone new to the AppSec field! 

The workshops Day is free to attend, however [registration is required](Register). 

### What is these workshops about? 

This year we are lucky enough to have **two** parallel workshops tracks for attendees to learn from.

**Track 1**  will be focused on Threat Modelling and secure coding and **Track 2** will be focused on attacking and securing APIs Both tracks will combine expert trainers with hands-on and practical exercises to help you get a better understanding of your chosen area.


### Goals   

The goal of the workshops tracks are to enable trainees get the initial understanding and hands-on skills required to find their path in the appsec field,   
whether as an appsec professional or as a developer of secure, resilient, and robust code.
