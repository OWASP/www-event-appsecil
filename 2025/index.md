The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference is the largest conference in Israel and the region for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. [Over 700 people attended the previous conference](/2023/)! 

But AppSecIL is not just for security experts!

Close to 1000 developers, testers, architects, product designers, and managers will attend this year.  
Everyone involved with the software lifecycle is welcome, regardless of type of software, website, mobile app, or any other type of application.

If you are responsible for, or involved with:
  - web security
  - devops security
  - cloud security
  - mobile security
  - application security
  - software development
  - quality assurance

  ... you should join us at AppSecIL!

{{ site.data.year-2025.config.title }} will have a lecture track from an amazing group of speakers, "unconference" style discussion sessions, and additional activities such as a Capture the Flag competition.   

We also host sponsors to promote the latest advances in security technology relevant to application security and developers.
