# Call for Presentations

What are we looking for? Anything and everything AppSec! Application security, software security, web security…
In general, the only restriction on the subject of the talks is being related to Application Security or Software Security in some way (not necessarily Web).
We will not accept any talks regarding other aspects of Security, that are not applicative in nature. Talks at any technical level can be accepted.

We’re looking for fresh, vendor-neutral talks that span all levels of expertise—whether you’re presenting cutting-edge research, sharing lessons from the trenches, or showcasing real-world case studies. 

## Topics

While all submissions must have an applicative focus, we welcome diverse perspectives, including but not limited to:

---

* *Secure Development: Secure coding practices, supply chain security, static analysis, threat modeling, countermeasures, SDLC, and DevSecOps*
* *Mobile Security: Mobile development, testing methodologies, and securing mobile web applications*
* *Cloud Security: Offensive and defensive approaches to securing cloud-based applications*
* *Applicative Infrastructure Security: Database security, serverless frameworks, identity management, and container security*
* *Penetration Testing: Techniques, tools, exploit development, and evasion strategies*
* *Emerging Web Technologies: Security challenges in new frameworks and technologies*
* *IoT Security: Securing connected devices and Internet of Things ecosystems*
* *Applied Cryptography: Research, algorithm usage, and cryptographic attacks or defenses*
* *Incident Response: Threat detection, triage, forensics, and malware analysis*
* *OWASP Tools and Projects: Real-world implementations and success stories*
* *Policy and Legal: Privacy, compliance, and high-level security considerations*
* *Fun Hacks and Creative Ideas: Cool exploits, social engineering, and more*

We are particularly interested in hearing from practitioners in large organizations who can share field-tested case studies or practical solutions. Priority will be given to original content not presented at other events.

Whether you’re a first-time speaker or a seasoned pro, this is your chance to engage with one of the largest AppSec communities, showcase your expertise, and contribute to advancing the field.
