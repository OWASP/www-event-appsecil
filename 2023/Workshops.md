## Workshops Day

These workshops are **NOT** for security experts with many years of experience, but for the rest of us:   

The aim is to provide a hands-on, crash course in key application security topics for developers, QA engineers, and anyone new to the AppSec field! 

The workshops day is free to attend, however [registration is required](/Register). 

#### **IMPORTANT: Please see the workshop pre-requisites [on this page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B8cWvXOJpbXZhERl1eqezQIesZBcpM9MrwKWQrT_Ejs/edit?usp=sharing) and complete the form with your workshop requests [on this page](https://forms.gle/qj4CYfTGtEzs5Fde6).**

We canâ€™t guarantee places in workshops as entry will have to be "first come, first served" but filling out this form will help us try make sure there is enough space

### What are these workshops about? 

This year we are lucky enough to have **three** parallel workshops tracks for attendees to learn from.

**Track 1**  will be focused on Threat Modelling and Secure Coding, **Track 2** will be focused on attacking and securing APIs and **Track 3** will be focused on DevSecOps.
All tracks will combine expert trainers with hands-on and practical exercises to help you get a better understanding of your chosen area.


### Goals   

The goal of the workshops tracks are to enable trainees get the initial understanding and hands-on skills required to find their path in the appsec field,   
whether as an appsec professional or as a developer of secure, resilient, and robust code.
