## Registration 

This year, we are charging a relatively small, symbolic fee for attending the conference in order to give us slightly more certainty regarding numbers in our new, more professional venue. There are heavy discounts for soldiers, students and OWASP members and anyone who feels the ticket price is unattainable for them, should be in contact with [Ori Troyna](mailto:ori.troyna@owasp.org) as we do not want anyone to miss out.

The Workshops day remains free and aimed at developers and newcomers to application security rather than experienced professionals.

[Register for AppSecIL now!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/594694937567/)

***Please do not register for the Workshops unless you are definitely suitable for them and you are confident you will be able to attend!***

### Membership 

Please consider [joining OWASP as an individual member](https://owasp.org/membership/). As a not-for-profit organization, OWASP has no direct income other than sponsorships and membership fees.  

For only **50 USD**, you can **get a discounted ticket for this conference**, support this organization, help ensure we can continue to deliver great content, and you also get various other member benefits (including a discount for Global Conferences). [Learn more about OWASP and membership benefits](https://owasp.org/membership/).  

Don't forget to specify the Israel chapter when you join! This will allocate a small portion of your membership fee to the running of the Israel chapter, and mark your account as associated with the Israel chapter. And you'll get a small gift at the conference, a token of our appreciation!  

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open-source, not-for-profit application security organization made up of corporations, educational organizations, and individuals from around the world. Providing free, vendor-neutral, practical, cost-effective application security guidance, the OWASP Foundation is the de-facto standards body for web application security used by developers and organizations globally.
