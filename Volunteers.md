Wonderful people of the AppSec & DevSec Community,
OWASP AppSec IL will take place this month on the 16-17.05 in EXPO TLV.

We planned an amazing event and hoping to see you all there!

More information about the conference can be found on the [Agenda](Agenda) page!

At the moment, we are looking for volunteers to support different activities at the conference.

Of course we are taking care of our volunteers, and there are some benefits ;)
