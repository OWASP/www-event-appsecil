## Volunteers

Wonderful people of the AppSec & DevSec Community,

OWASP AppSecIL will take place on May 16th and 17th, 2023 in EXPO TLV.

We have planned an amazing event and we are hoping to see you all there!

More information about the conference can be found on the [Agenda](Agenda) page!

At the moment, we are looking for volunteers to support different activities at the conference.

Of course we are taking care of our volunteers, and there are some benefits ;)
