## Sponsors

Sponsorship keeps our OWASP community active and allows us to improve the conference, which is free for everyone and not funded by ticket sales. Sponsorship fees cover event costs, and any remainder goes to ongoing Chapter activities.

We offer several premium tiers, a la carte options, and a cost-effective Community Supporter level for smaller organizations.
