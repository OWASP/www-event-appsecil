## Registration

For many years, OWASP AppSecIL was completely free to attend, a community conference powered entirely by volunteers and generous sponsors. As the conference grew, we moved into more professional venues and our expenses rose accordingly. Today, AppSecIL has become the largest single-day application security conference in the world, and accommodating an event of this scale is increasingly challenging. There are very few venues that can host so many attendees, provide multiple parallel tracks in comfort, and still remain reasonably located and accessible.


Over the past couple of years, we continued to keep ticket prices significantly below the real per-attendee cost, staying true to our commitment to accessibility. At the same time, we’ve seen that many registrations are made by companies purchasing tickets for their employees. This has meant that volunteer effort and sponsor funding were, in practice, helping subsidize corporate attendance.


This year, we are introducing a new pricing policy to ensure long-term sustainability while still supporting individuals in our community:

Corporate rate: 200 ₪                          
Regular individual rate: 130 ₪

**To help organizations send multiple employees, group discounts will be available on the corporate rate.**
